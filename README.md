## Installing OpenCV

If you are on mac just follow [these instructions] (http://blogs.wcode.org/2014/10/howto-install-build-and-use-opencv-macosx-10-10/)

Otherwise, otherwise the steps are similar (but is up to you).


## Generating xcode files

Type this:

```
mkdir xcode
cd xcode
cmake -G "Xcode" ..
```

for debugging purposes run the program located at:

```
xcode/Debug/DisplayOpenCVHero
```
